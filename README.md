# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub. Don't know yet what it might contain.

// My name is Marcin Torchala. After graduating polygraphy I decided to become a programmer, because it is seems way more fun and interesting. Currently I am learning ropes of C++. My dream is to draw a comic and make a game about it. This is my first project on Github.
